* Todos
  - Get rid of jQuery.
    Look at things like:
    - https://github.blog/2018-09-06-removing-jquery-from-github-frontend/
    - https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/template/
    - https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom
  - Get rid of mutable state and use of Refs + STM.
    - Even the connections between ValueModels can be immutable; i.e. the dataflow network.
    - Each app will have an explicit event loop; we will then control time as a first class citizen instead of trying to pretend it is not there.
    - Each app (and/or possibly group of apps) will have a context that holds state during the event loop.
    - By doing this I can pretty much get rid of all the two-phase commit stuff.
